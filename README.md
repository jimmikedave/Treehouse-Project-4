This project is a browser-based, word guessing game called 'Phrase Hunter'.
JavaScript and OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) are used to select a random
phrase and let the player guess the phrase, by selecting letters using an on
screen keyboard.

The Game class selects the random phrase that will be used throughout the game.
Based on the player's interaction with the game this class will start the game,
show matched letters, take lives away, disable letters, show a win or lose screen,
and reset the game.

The Phrase class adds a placeholder for the random phrase once it is determined.
This class will also check if a selected letter matches a phrase letter, and will
show the letter if a letter is matched.

Style Changes
- changed the game's background color to skyblue
